# NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
# In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
# NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
# The array object in NumPy is called ndarray,
# it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

# NumPy is usually imported under the np alias.
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
#print(np.__version__)
